<p align="justify">First of all, the aim we go to Penang is to complete our group assignment for subject IMD212 (Introduction to Electronic Records Management) in Semester 3. Therefore, we must interview an organization that apply Electronic Records Management System (ERMS) in their organization. So, we have select the National Archive of Penang which is located in the KOMTAR Building.</p>

<p align="justify">We depart from UiTM at 8 a.m by taking a taxi to go to the Sungai Petaniâ€™s Commuter Station. Then we take the commuter from Sungai Petani to Butterworth. After we have arrived Butterworth we take a ferry in order to go to Penang. Once we are in the ferry, there is a kind man who are willing to take us to the KOMTAR building without charge so, we did not have to take a Grab. During in the journey to the KOMTAR, the man told us that his child is at hospital. After we have arrived at KOMTAR we want to give him fees but he told that there is no need. To pay his kindness, we pray that his child will get well soon.</p>
<br>

<br>
<br>
<p align="justify">We arrived at the National Archive of Penang at 10.00 a.m. Because the archive officer told us to came back at 11.00 a.m. so, we filled our tummy first with decent breakfast at KFC because we are hungry and did not take any breakfast yet at that time. Then, when it is 11.00 a.m. we came back to the Archive and start the interview session.</p>
<br>
<br>

<br>
<br>
<p align="justify">After we have complete the interview session, we decide to have a lunch at Deen Maju which is a nasi kandar stall. The price for the meals are reasonable and also delicious. I ordered fried chicken and gravy.</p>
<br>
<br>
<img src="jpg/street art.jpg" border="3" width="25% lenght="25%" hspace="37%">
<img src="jpg/street art2.jpg" border="3" width="25% lenght="25%" hspace="37%">
<br>
<br>
<p align="justify">After we have eat, we take a Grab and visit the Street Art. There are so many interesting 3D paintings and we take many photos together. I have never been to the Street Art before and it is my first time going there.</p>
<br>
<br>
<img src="jpg/laut1.jpg" border="3" width="25% lenght="25%" hspace="37%">
<br>
<br>
<p align="justify">Although there are not much places that we visit, but for me it is still a good memories because I am able to do what I have never do before such as take the ferry. I never been in a ferry before. It is nice because I am able to see the beautiful sea. I really love to watch the ocean or sea. I love to feel the soft breeze on my face. That is one of the best experience that ever happen in my life. Lastly, when it is 4.30 p.m. we take a ferry and went back to UiTM. All of us a quite tired but all of us feel happy</p>
