<h2>Sound Of Ocean (Legend of The Blue Sea Soundtrack)</h2>
<p align="center">The Drama title is Legend of The Blue Sea. I really love this drama because it is funny and have sentimental value at the same time. This drama told about a beautiful mermaid and a handsome man that fall in love with each other. There are many obstacles that they face in order to be together. Sometimes, the mermaid give up on this love but the man still not losing his hope and told the mermaid that everything can be fine. However, the mermaid cannot be at land at a long time either she will died because she also needs water. So, the man must leave the mermaid for a good reason to make sure his love still alive. He does not want to be selfish. Then, after the mermaid has come back to the sea, the man decided to build a house that is near at the sea. He hope that one day the mermaid will find him and they will live happily at the house near the sea. This music is my favourite soundtrack from this drama. This drama's main stars are Lee Minho and Jeon Ji Yeon</p>
