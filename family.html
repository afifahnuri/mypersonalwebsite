<p align="justify">I really love my family because my family always be by my side and they never left me. Although sometimes we do bicker about something but our family bond will never fade because we love each other. My father married with my mom at the age of 25 years old. They live together happily and then they start to have a daughter in their one year marriage. Then, finally our family is complete which has 7 family members that is closed by my youngest brother named Harith Ihsan. We live together happily and we always do everything together. We have a strong bond with each other. However, nowadays everyone grows day by day and we feel that sometimes our family have to split up and cannot be together like the old times. It is because, everyone have their one responsibility. My elder sister has go to work, me and my brother must leave home to study at universities.</p>
<p align="justify">Sometimes, I do realize that our parents miss the old times when all of us are together. I am also sad because, i rarely spent time with my parents because of my thick schedule. I realize that my father and mother are becoming old and old now and sometimes I am sad if I imagine they are not by my side anymore. However, I always remember to pray good things to my family because I really love them. We have gone through many obstacles and challenges in our life but we never fail to support each other. One of my precious memory about my family is when they celebrate my birthday on previous July this year. They sang a song and pray for me. I love my family so much...</p>
